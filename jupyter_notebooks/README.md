### Jupyter Notebook support
I've included this Jupyter Notebook file with code and comments to PgAdmin with Juptyter notebook.
Be sure to use a Conda Environment with the following packages installed:
```bash
import psycopg2 as pg2
import pandas as pd
import getpass
```

Open PgAdmin, then connect to the `dvdrental` database. Finally, open `connecting_to_PgAdmin.ipynb` and execute the cells to write SQL queries using Jupyer Notebook.
