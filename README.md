By the end of this course, you'll be able to describe what SQL (Structured Query Language) is, write SQL queries, answer questions by accessing and querying a database, and create and manipulate tables in databases. Ideally, you're familiar with spreadsheets, but that is not a requirement since I will go over a high-level overview of databases and spreadsheets.
